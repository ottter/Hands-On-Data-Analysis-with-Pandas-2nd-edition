# Chapter 06 - Task 04 (chap 06 exercises)

## Exercise 01

1. Using seaborn, create a heatmap to visualize the correlation coefficients between earthquake magnitude and whether there was a tsunami for earthquakes measured with the mb magnitude type.

## Exercise 02

> Create a box plot of Facebook volume traded and closing prices, and draw reference lines for the bounds of a Tukey fence with a multiplier of 1.5. The bounds will be at Q1 − 1.5 × IQR and Q3 + 1.5 × IQR. Be sure to use the quantile() method on the data to make this easier. (Pick whichever orientation you prefer for the plot, but make sure to use subplots.)

## Exercise 03

> Plot the evolution of cumulative COVID-19 cases worldwide, and add a dashed vertical line on the date that it surpassed 1 million. Be sure to format the tick labels on the y-axis accordingly.

## Exercise 04

> Use axvspan() to shade a rectangle from '2018-07-25' to '2018-07-31', which marks the large decline in Facebook price on a line plot of the closing price.

## Exercise 05

> Using the Facebook stock price data, annotate the following three events on a line plot of the closing price:
a) Disappointing user growth announced after close on July 25, 2018
b) Cambridge Analytica story breaks on March 19, 2018 (when it affected the market)
c) FTC launches investigation on March 20, 2018Further reading 389

## Exercise 06

> Modify the reg_resid_plots() function to use a matplotlib colormap instead of cycling between two colors. Remember, for this use case, we should pick a qualitative colormap or make our own.
