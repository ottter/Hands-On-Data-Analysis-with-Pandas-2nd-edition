RV,"TOI 540 b is a hot planet slightly smaller than Earth orbiting the low-mass star 2MASS J05051443-4756154. It was discovered in TESS data by Ment et al. in 2020, supported by ground-based follow-up observations by the MEarth team. Based on the observed mass-radius distribution of small exoplanets at similar insolations the planet is likely terrestrial. It's close proximity to Earth make it an alluring target to study atmospheric erosion due to the strong X-ray emission from the star. It is also among the most accessible targets for transmission and emission spectroscopy and eclipse photometry with JWST.",,2020,,0.01223,1.239149,TOI-540 b,,,Confirmed planets,20/09/30
