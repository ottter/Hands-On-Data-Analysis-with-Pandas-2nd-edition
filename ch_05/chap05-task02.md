# Chapter 05 - Task 02 (chap 05 exercises)

## Exercise 01

> Plot the rolling 20-day minimum of the Facebook closing price using pandas.

## Exercise 02

> Create a histogram and KDE of the change from open to close in the price of Facebook stock.

## Exercise 03

> Using the earthquake data, create box plots for the magnitudes of each magType used in Indonesia.

## Exercise 04

> Make a line plot of the difference between the weekly maximum high price and the weekly minimum low price for Facebook. This should be a single line.

## Exercise 05

> Plot the 14-day moving average of the daily change in new COVID-19 cases in Brazil, China, India, Italy, Spain, and the USA:
> a) First, use the diff() method that was introduced in the Working with time series data section of Chapter 4, Aggregating Pandas DataFrames, to calculate the day-over-day change in new cases. Then, use rolling() to calculate the 14-day moving average.
> b) Make three subplots: one for China; one for Spain and Italy; and one for Brazil,
India, and the USA.

## Exercise 06

> Using matplotlib and pandas, create two subplots side-by-side showing the effect that after-hours trading has had on Facebook's stock prices:
> a) The first subplot will contain a line plot of the daily difference between that day's opening price and the prior day's closing price (be sure to review the Working with time series data section of Chapter 4, Aggregating Pandas DataFrames, for an easy way to do this).
> b) The second subplot will be a bar plot showing the net effect this had monthly, using resample().Further reading 321
> c) Bonus #1: Color the bars according to whether there are gains in the stock price (green) or drops in the stock price (red).
> d) Bonus #2: Modify the x-axis of the bar plot to show the three-letter abbreviation for the month.
